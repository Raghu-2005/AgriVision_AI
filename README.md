AgriVision: Crafting the Future of Farming with AI.

AgriVision is a project aimed at finding cultivatable land for agricultural needs using computer technology and image processing techniques. The lack of suitable land for food crops cultivation is a significant challenge in improving the farming sector. With increasing population and demand for food, this project serves as a starting point for further research and development in the field of agriculture and food production.
